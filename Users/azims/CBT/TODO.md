# SKY / ORION — MASTER TASK BOARD & ROADMAP

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for ongoing work, completed milestones, and upcoming technical deliverables.  
> **Rule for all AI agents:** When starting any new session, read this file and `AGENTS.md` before planning work. Update this file as tasks are started, completed, or refined.

## 🧭 System Core Architecture & Design Decisions

### What We Enforce
1. **Deterministic Core:** Position sizing, stop-loss calculation, daily loss limits, portfolio heat, and hard kill switches are 100% deterministic Python code. AI never places unrestricted orders.
2. **AI Role:** Discovery, hypothesis generation, classification, multimodal extraction, and natural language explanation.
3. **Evidence-Driven Progression:**
   $$\text{Idea} \longrightarrow \text{Formalized} \longrightarrow \text{Backtested} \longrightarrow \text{Out-of-Sample (OOS)} \longrightarrow \text{Paper Trading} \longrightarrow \text{Human Approval} \longrightarrow \text{Live}$$
4. **Mandatory Provenance:** Every external source (URL, PDF, YouTube transcript, image, audio) is cryptographically hashed and indexed with source metadata.
5. **Zero-Shake UI:** Persistent chart instances with incremental WebSocket bar updates — zero full-page flickering or chart remounts.

### What We Reject / Defer
* ❌ Scraping private social platforms (TikTok / Instagram / Facebook private endpoints) without official APIs.
* ❌ Silently updating strategy parameters after a single losing trade without post-trade autopsy and walk-forward verification.
* ❌ Fabricating backtest win rates or using in-sample overfitted indicators without out-of-sample confirmation.

## 🎯 Active & Upcoming Todo List

### Priority 0 (P0) — Immediate Core Deliverables (COMPLETED)
- [x] **P0.1: Universal Provenance & Ingestion Store (`core/provenance_engine.py`)**
  - Cryptographic SHA-256 content hashing, source metadata tracking, and tamper-proof storage in `provenance_records`.
  - Supports URLs, PDFs, Markdown, text, audio transcripts, and YouTube sources with duplicate detection.
  - Exposed `POST /api/ingest/source`, `GET /api/ingest/provenance`, `GET /api/ingest/provenance/{source_id}`.
- [x] **P0.2: Formal Strategy Compiler & Genome Validator (`core/strategy_compiler.py`)**
  - Converts natural language / extracted hypotheses into deterministic `CompiledStrategy` definitions.
  - Enforces explicit definitions (timeframes, entry triggers, mandatory invalidation levels, regime exclusions).
  - Explicitly flags incomplete / vague strategies as `STATUS = NOT_BACKTESTABLE`.
  - Exposed `POST /api/strategy/compile` and `GET /api/strategy/genomes`.
